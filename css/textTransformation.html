    <p>Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.[10] Emissions as well as other 
        significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their
         economies. For this reason, many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable
          tourism to mitigate the negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism. The United Nations World 
          Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development 
          Goals, through programs like the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017,[11] and
           programs like Tourism for SDGs focusing on how SDG 8, SDG 12 and SDG 14 implicate tourism in creating a
            sustainable economy.
